# AutoServe

## What is AutoServe?
- AutoServe is a Python bot designed to automate the fast food worker job in the Roblox game "Welcome to Bloxburg."

## How does it work?
- AutoServe uses an open-source Python library called OpenCV for image detection. It detects items on the screen and NPC orders to automate the tasks.

## How do I use it?
- Obtain the executable or build from source.

- Load into the game and start your shift.

- Run the program and wait for it to load.

- Once it has finished loading, go to this specific cash register for the best performance of the bot.

- Let the bot run!

- Once you've got the cash, just press "q" on your keyboard and stop the bot. Simple!

## NOTE:
- For those who believe this is cheating, it is not. This process only automates a task. Additionally, you will still need to manually refill your stats when they decrease and will also make the same amount of money as a human.
