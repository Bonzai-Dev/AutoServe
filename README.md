## What is AutoServe?
- AutoServe is a Python bot designed to automate the fast food worker job in the Roblox game "Welcome to Bloxburg".

## How does it work?
- AutoServe uses an open-source Python library called OpenCV for image detection. It detects items on the screen and NPC orders to automate the tasks and determine where to click.

## How do I use it?
- Obtain the executable from the lates version of the program or build from source.
- Modify the settings if needed. You can also retake the screenshots if the bot isint detecting all the items.
- Load into the game and start your shift.

- Go to any cash register.

- Run the program after the animations on the UI has stoppoed.

- Let the bot run!

- Once you've got the cash, just spam "q" on your keyboard and stop the bot. Simple!

## NOTE:
- For those who believe this is cheating or hacking, it is not. The program is not modifying in-game values. Additionally, you will still need to manually refill your stats when they decrease and will make the same amount of money as if a human did the work.
- This bot is also for educational purposes only. Its sole purpose is to teach how programs are used to automate tasks in games and spread awareness of  auto-farming. 
- I am also NOT liable for any damages caused by the use of the bot, such as account termination or data loss.
- If you have any questions involving on how the bot works, then feel free to create a new question in the issues.
