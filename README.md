## What is AutoServe?
- AutoServe is a Python bot designed to automate the fast food worker job in the Roblox game "Welcome to Bloxburg".

## How does it work?
- AutoServe uses an open-source Python library called OpenCV for image detection. It detects items on the screen and NPC orders to automate the tasks and determine where to click.

## How do I use it?
- Obtain the executable from the lates version of the program or build from source.
- Modify the settings if needed. You can also retake the screenshots if the bot isint detecting all the items.
- Load into the game and start your shift.

- Run the program and wait for it to load.

- Once it has finished loading, close or tab out of the control panel and go to this specific cash register for the best performance of the bot.

- Let the bot run!

- Once you've got the cash, just spam "q" on your keyboard and stop the bot. Simple!

## NOTE:
- For those who believe this is cheating, it is not. This process only automates a task. Additionally, you will still need to manually refill your stats when they decrease and will also make the same amount of money as a human.
